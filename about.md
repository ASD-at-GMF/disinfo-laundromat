# About
The purpose of the laundromat, how to use it effectively, and how to interpret the results 

## The Laundromat
The laundromat tool is a **lead generation tool** to try and determine if and how websites share architecture and content. *Even the strongest evidence from the laundromat tool requires corroboration through further investigation and additional evidence*
The laundromat tool provides two functions: Content Similarity Search and Domain Forensics Matching. 
Content Similarity Search attempts to detect URLs where a given text snippet occurs. It does not provide evidence of where that text originated or any relationship between two entities posting two similar texts. Detemination of a given text's provenance is outside the scope of this tool.
Domain Forensics Matching attempts to find aspects of a website which indicate what makes it unique, give insight into its architecture/design, or show how its used/tracked. These indicators are compared for items with high degrees of similarity and matches are provided to the user

#### Data Collection and Use

The Information Laundromat tool collects data through two forms, as part of its functions: Content Similarity Search and Domain Forensics Matching.

It compares these indicators across websites to find high degrees of similarity and provides indicators and match results to the user.

                <h2 id="the-laundromat">The Laundromat</h2>
                <p>The laundromat tool provides two functions: Content Similarity Search and Domain Forensics Matching:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Content Similarity Search attempts to detect URLs where a given text snippet occurs. It does not
                        provide evidence of where that text originated or any relationship between two entities posting
                        two similar texts. Detemination of a given text&#39;s provenance is outside the scope of this
                        tool.</li>
                    <li>Domain Forensics Matching attempts to find aspects of a website which indicate what makes it
                        unique, give insight into its architecture/design, or show how its used/tracked. These
                        indicators are compared for items with high degrees of similarity and matches are provided to
                        the user</li>

                    System and Interpreting Results</h3>

                <p>Each indicator is associated with evidentiary tier and are subject to <a
                        href="#Interpreting Indicator Validity">interpretation</a>. </p>
                <p>Tier 1 indicators: <a href="#Interpreting Indicator Validity"><strong>WHEN VALID</strong></a> are
                    typically unique or highly indicative of the provenance of a website. This includes unique IDs for
                    verification purposes and web services like Google, Yandex, etc as well as site metadata like WHOIS
                    information and certification, <a href="#Interpreting Indicator Validity"><strong>WHEN
                            VALID</strong></a>, as DDOS protection services like Cloudflare and shared hosting services
                    like Bluehost can provide spurious matches. </p>
                <p>Tier 2 indicators: Tier 2 indicators, <a href="#Interpreting Indicator Validity"><strong>WHEN
                            VALID</strong></a>, offer a moderate level of certainty regarding the provenance of a
                    website. These are not as unique as Tier 1 indicators but provide valuable context. This tier
                    includes IPs within the same subnet, matching meta tags, and commonalities in standard and custom
                    response headers</p>
                <p>Tier 3: Tertiary Indicators
                    Tier 3 indicators, <a href="#Interpreting Indicator Validity"><strong>WHEN VALID</strong></a>, are
                    the least specific but can still support broader analyses when combined with higher-tier indicators.
                    These include shared CSS classes, UUIDs, and Content Management Systems </p>
                <h4 id="interpreting-indicator-validity">Interpreting Indicator Validity</h4>
                <p>Understanding the validity of indicators is crucial in the analysis of websites&#39; provenance and
                    connections. Indicators can range from high-confidence markers of direct relationships to spurious
                    matches that may mislead investigations. It is essential to approach each indicator with a critical
                    eye and corroborate findings with additional evidence.</p>
                <p><strong>High Confidence Indicators:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unique IDs for verification purposes: These are often excellent evidence of a connection or
                        shared ownership, such as unique Google Analytics IDs that directly link websites to the same
                        account.</li>
                    <li>Domain Certificate sharing: When websites share a specific SSL certificate, it often (but not
                        always, see below) indicates a direct relationship, as certificates are typically issued to and
                        managed by the same entity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Discovering two websites with the same unique Google Analytics ID AND a shared, specific SSL
                    certificate suggests a high-confidence link, indicating shared management or ownership.</p>
                <p><strong>Spurious Matches:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using services like Cloudflare: While Cloudflare and similar DDOS protection services offer
                        valuable security benefits, they also mask true IP addresses and distribute shared SSL
                        certificates across multiple sites. This can lead to false positives in linking unrelated
                        websites based on shared IP addresses or certificates.</li>
                    <li>Shared hosting services: Websites hosted on shared services like Bluehost may share IP addresses
                        with hundreds of unrelated sites, making IP-based matches unreliable without further context.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Identifying that multiple websites are behind Cloudflare does not inherently indicate a connection
                    beyond choosing a common, popular service for performance and security enhancements. All tier 1 and
                    2 indicators should be scrutinized carefully to determine if a match is valid or spurious</p>
                <h5 id="example-investigation-">Example Investigation:</h5>
                <p>An analyst investigating a network of disinformation websites notices that several sites share a
                    specific Facebook Pixel ID, indicating a potential link in their online marketing strategies. This
                    Tier 1 indicator suggests a high-confidence connection. However, upon further investigation,
                    it&#39;s revealed that these sites also use Cloudflare for DDOS protection, sharing SSL certificates
                    and IP addresses with numerous unrelated sites. While the shared Facebook Pixel ID remains a strong
                    indicator of connection, the shared certificates and IP addresses through Cloudflare are deemed
                    spurious matches and the additional sites are discarded from the network. The analyst corroborates
                    the initial finding with additional Tier 1 indicators, such as unique verification IDs, solidifying
                    the connection between the sites beyond the spurious matches introduced by shared security services.
                </p>
                <p>In interpreting indicator validity, analysts must weigh the evidence, seek corroboration, and
                    consider the broader context to distinguish between high-confidence connections and potentially
                    misleading, spurious matches.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>1-cert-domain - Domain Certificate</strong>:
                            An SSL certificate is a digital certificate that authenticates a website&#39;s or multiple
                            websites&#39; identity and enables an encrypted connection. <em>A shared certificate between
                                two sites is strong evidence of a link between sites, as typically a certificate must be
                                issued for all those sites at once by a single entity and cannot easily be spoofed.
                                However, some web hosting and DDOS protection services bundle certificates for unrelated
                                sites, so carefully research any matches.</em></p>

                    <li>
                        <p><strong>1-crypto-wallet - Cryptocurrency Wallet</strong>:
                            A digital wallet used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and
                            Ethereum. <em>The presence of a cryptocurrency wallet address can link a site or an
                                individual to cryptocurrency transactions, potentially indicating financial sources or
                                preferences. However, due to the pseudonymous nature of such wallets, additional
                                information is required to definitively establish ownership or connections.</em></p>

                            The unique name that identifies a website, which is registered in the Domain Name System
                            (DNS). <em>The domain name can provide insights into the nature or origin of a website.
                                Commonalities in domain names may suggest shared affiliations or intents. However, the
                                ease of registering domain names requires careful analysis to avoid false
                                associations.</em></p>

                            The last part of a domain name, typically representing a category or country code. <em>A
                                domain suffix can indicate the intended audience or origin of a website. Similar
                                suffixes across different sites might suggest a geographical or organizational link.
                                Yet, the global accessibility of most suffixes means this should not be a sole

                            A unique identifier for the Facebook Pixel, an analytics tool that allows website owners to
                            measure the effectiveness of their advertising by understanding the actions people take on
                            their website. <em>Shared Facebook Pixel IDs across sites can indicate common ownership or a
                                shared marketing strategy. However, third-party marketing agencies might use the same ID
